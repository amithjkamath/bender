# Evaluation and Deployment: final points to consider

At this stage, you have curated the data set, build in an organized fashion: a model that surpasses previously published benchmarks, and are now ready to show it to your clinical collaborators. In this episode of the [BENDER Series](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bender), we go over some final checks to make this translation of research-grade models to something that could be tested in clinics better.

TODO

External test data set (out-of-distribution, or from a different geography, patient population, or clinical setup) - robustness

Multiple vendors (from an imaging hardware perspective) and varied protocols of acquisition of data

Average metrics versus robustness and reliability across distributions

Imbalanced testing dataset categories/pixel-labels

Dealing with reviewer #2 and other situations
