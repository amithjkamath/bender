# Training models: tips and tricks

## References

* https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/ includes some great general recipes for model training (general because it isn't Medical Imaging in particular): we'd like to do a specialization of this, assuming readers are already aware of these fundamental rules. 

* https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/clara-train-sdk/pt/mmar.html - specifically for medical AI models. 

* Also see this blog post for great ideas: https://medium.com/miccai-educational-initiative/project-roadmap-for-the-medical-imaging-student-working-with-deep-learning-351add6066cf (especially around Andrei Karpathy's recipe for training Deep Learning models)

* Consider following the MICCAI Hackathon reproducibility checklist: https://github.com/JunMa11/MICCAI-Reproducibility-Checklist to ensure that your pipeline is not too exotic, and future researchers can build on your work!
