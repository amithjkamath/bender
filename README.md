# The BENDER series:

This repository supports the BENDER (BEst practices in medical imagiNg DEep leaRning) series of videos for the MICCAI Education Challenge, 2022.

## Episode 1: “The data pile” 

See [checklist](/episode01/checklist.md) for a list of keepawakes while dealing with clinical data. We believe checking off all of these as a bare minimum would help avoid surprises later on, in your project. 

## Episode 2: “Medical image computing is not the same as computing on medical images” 

## Episode 3: “Modeling”

## Episode 4: “Evaluating your model: we are out of the sandbox”
