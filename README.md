# The BENDER series:

This repository supports the [BENDER (BEst practices in medical imagiNg DEep leaRning) series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFwdflE4leRpqIz-F68pvwFATIOEwrSHp) for the MICCAI Education Challenge, 2022.

## Episode 1: “The data pile” 

See [checklist](/episode01/checklist.md) for a list of keepawakes while dealing with clinical data. We believe checking off all of these as a bare minimum would help avoid surprises later on, in your project. 

## Episode 2: “Medical image computing is not the same as computing on medical images” 

See [glossary](/episode02/glossar.md) for a glossary of common terms used in the Deep Learning world, with a special focus on Medical Imaging and clinical lingo.

## Episode 3: “Modeling”

This episode focuses on the next step of actually building a model: starting from a naive implementation, walking through the process of improving it iteratively to get to a better state, while also understanding how to evaluate if it is indeed getting better!

## Episode 4: “Evaluating your model: we are out of the sandbox”

In this final episode, the focus is on final evaluations and deployment: specific points that are important to keep in mind for clinical relevance, out-of-distribution data, and other interesting bits.
