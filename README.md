# The 🤖 BENDER series:

This repository supports the [BENDER (BEst practices in medical imagiNg DEep leaRning) series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFwdflE4leRpqIz-F68pvwFATIOEwrSHp) for the MICCAI Education Challenge, 2022.

## Episode 1: “The data pile”

See [checklist](/episode01/checklist.md) for a list of keepawakes while dealing with clinical data. We believe checking off all of these as a bare minimum would help avoid surprises later on, in your project. 

## Episode 2: “Medical image computing is not the same as computing on medical images”

See [glossary](/episode02/glossar.md) for a glossary of common terms used in the Deep Learning world, with a special focus on Medical Imaging and clinical lingo.

## Episode 3: “Modeling”

This episode focuses on the next step of actually building a model: starting from a naive implementation, walking through the process of improving it iteratively to get to a better state, while also understanding how to evaluate if it is indeed getting better!

## Episode 4: “Evaluating your model: we are out of the sandbox”

alt="BENDER episode 04" width="640" height="480" border="10" /></a>

In this final episode, the focus is on evaluation and deployment: specific points that are important to keep in mind for clinical relevance, out-of-distribution data, and other interesting bits.

We hope you learn something new about how to get started with Medical Imaging and Deep Learning, and more importantly, that you have fun while learning! (If you have suggestions for improvement, please do not hesitate to create an [issue here](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bender/issues))
