# References for model and data organization

https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/ includes some great general recipes for model training (general because it isn't Medical Imaging in particular): we'd like to do a specialization of this, assuming readers are already aware of these fundamental rules. 

https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/clara-train-sdk/pt/mmar.html - specifically for medical AI models. 

https://bids.neuroimaging.io - Brain Imaging Data structure - for organizing multiple subject files for neuroimaging.

Also see this blog post for great ideas: https://medium.com/miccai-educational-initiative/project-roadmap-for-the-medical-imaging-student-working-with-deep-learning-351add6066cf (especially around Andrei Karpathy's recipe for training Deep Learning models)

Also consider re-using the MICCAI Hackathon reproducibility checklist: https://github.com/JunMa11/MICCAI-Reproducibility-Checklist
